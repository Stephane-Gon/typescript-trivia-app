============= Trivia App =========================

  In this project I decided to create a trivia app,
in order to improve my skill with typescript;

  - The player can check stats like:
    - Best time percentage in a game;
    - Best Game overall;
    - Previuous game;
    - Most correct answer's in a game;
  
  - The player can choose next trivia details like:
    - Difficulty;
    - Category;
    - Number of questions;
  
  - The player has 20sec to answer each question,
  if he doesn't answer in time the next question will show and he will get 
  no points on the one he missed;

  - At the end the player can check game states like:
    - Time percentage to answer the questions;
    - Number of unanswered questions;
    - Number of correct answer's;
    - Percentage of correct answer's;
    - And can check the answer he gave for each question and the correct answer;
